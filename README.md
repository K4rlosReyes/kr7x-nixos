```bash
# System information with detailed health check
system-info              # Comprehensive system status and health

# Flexible rebuild options  
rebuild                   # Quick rebuild and switch
rebuild --test           # Build and test without activating
rebuild --boot           # Build and activate on next boot
rebuild --dry-run        # Show what would be built
rebuild --rollback       # Rollback to previous generation

# Smart cleanup with options
cleanup                  # Interactive cleanup (keeps 7 days)
cleanup --force          # Non-interactive cleanup

- **Maintainable**: Simple configurations that are easy to understand and modify
- **Performance**: Security measures that don't impact development workflow

## 🎨 Customization

### Enabling/Disabling Modules

The configuration uses a modular approach. Enable or disable features in your host configuration:

```nix
myModules = {
  development = {
    enable = true;
    languages = [ "python" "go" "javascript" "nix" ];
    editors = [ "neovim" ];
    python = {
      enable = true;
      packageManager = "uv";  # Fast Python package management
    };
  };
  
  system = {
    security.enable = true;          # Basic security without bloat
    monitoring.enable = true;        # System health monitoring
    maintenance.enable = true;       # Automated maintenance
  };
  
  desktop = {
    enable = true;
    hyprland.enable = true;         # Wayland compositor
    applications.enable = true;      # Essential desktop apps
  };
};
```

### Adding New Hosts

1. Create a new directory in `hosts/`
2. Add `configuration.nix` and `hardware-configuration.nix`
3. Update `flake.nix` with the new host entry
4. Build with `nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#new-host`

- **Maintainable over Feature-Rich** - Easier to understand and modify
- **Performance over Completeness** - Fast rebuilds and responsive system

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! This configuration prioritizes:
- **Simplicity** - Easy to understand and modify
- **Modularity** - Clean separation of components
- **Documentation** - Clear code with explanations  
- **Practicality** - Real-world development focused
- **Performance** - Fast rebuilds and system responsiveness

### Development Workflow

## 💡 Tips & Best Practices

### First-Time Setup
1. **Start Small** - Enable only essential modules initially
2. **Test Incrementally** - Add features one at a time
3. **Backup First** - Always have a rollback plan ready
4. **Read the Code** - Understand what each module does

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Quick rebuild and switch
rebuild

# Check comprehensive system health
system-info

# Clean up after major changes (interactive)
cleanup

# Test configuration without activating
rebuild --test

# Check for issues before committing changes
nix flake check

# Show what would be built
rebuild --dry-run
```

### Customization Examples
```bash
# Enable Python development with specific tools
myModules.development.python = {
  enable = true;
  packages = [ "pytest" "mypy" "black" ];
};

# Add custom security settings
myModules.system.security = {
  enable = true;
  firewall.allowedTCPPorts = [ 8080 3000 ];
};

# Customize desktop applications
myModules.desktop.applications = {
  enable = true;
  categories = [ "development" "media" "office" ];
};
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures:**
```bash
# Check for syntax errors and configuration issues
nix flake check

# Test build without activating
rebuild --dry-run

# Update flake inputs if needed
nix flake update

# Clear cache if corrupted
sudo rm -rf /nix/var/nix/profiles/system-*-link
```

**System Issues:**
```bash
# Comprehensive system status and health check
system-info

# View recent logs
journalctl -xe

# Rollback to previous generation (quick method)
rebuild --rollback

# Or traditional rollback
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback
```

**Development Environment:**
```bash
# Rebuild neovim configuration
nvim --headless +qa

# Fix Python uv installation
uv self update

# Check Docker permissions
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

# Clean development environment
cleanup --keep-days 3
```

**Performance Issues:**
```bash
# Check system resources
system-info

# Monitor real-time performance
btop

# Clean up old generations aggressively
cleanup --keep-days 1 --force
```
